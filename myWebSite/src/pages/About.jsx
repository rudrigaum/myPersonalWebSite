      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am an iOS Developer with a strong background in native mobile development, specializing in Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI. I'm passionate about creating efficient and scalable applications from concept to implementation, focusing on API integration, unit testing, and implementing best practices in accessibility and analytics. I am driven by a passion for continuous learning and collaboration to create innovative solutions.

My journey in technology began with a degree in Information Systems and was further specialized with a postgraduate degree in Mobile Development. This period gave me a broad understanding of IT infrastructure and process automation, which shaped my foundation as a developer.

I then transitioned to mobile development, starting as an Android developer at Itaú Unibanco. After eight months, I made a decisive shift to iOS. At Itaú, I contributed to the development and maintenance of applications used by millions of customers, always prioritizing performance, security, and accessibility. I have extensive experience with Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI, applying architectures like MVVM and MVC. My work involved implementing new features, performing unit tests, integrating APIs, and optimizing critical flows to ensure scalability and code quality.

My experience demonstrates a strong ability to adapt and a solid commitment to delivering high-quality, impactful software solutions. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow professionally.</p>
